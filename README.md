PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
We intend to use technology to have far reaching effect on Military and other sectors. Actually our country is getting acquainted with various kind of technology but we want to uncover a new face of it by training our own Military with custom simulation of various war conditions or planned terrorist attacks . We not only just simulate it in a whole 3D world but to make it account for all real situations we added gun recoils , a feedback vest , a walking band. By using such simulation soldiers can be trained to suite any environment or physical location without being hurt and spending a lot of money. Using technology for a cause not luxury thing is what would make our country better and harness the underutilized potential of our technology. We presented our prototype Design at SRISHTI (in Aries) which was very much appreciated by many respected professors and was claimed as an innovative idea.

Why Our Project Can Outstand others ?
1) First our product can create any virtual situation be it Taj attack or a face to face battle. A great extent of flexibility
2) Second our vest receives a feedback from the simulation reflecting through vibration (improvised) or mild shock hits to feel the pain (can be improvised) and where he is being hit.
3) Third it is different from other simulations as user is not stationary. He needs to move or run physically to move in the game , hence boosting his stamina.
4) Simulated Damage effect of many guns and different recoils without even physically having them

Technical Details :
We had built our custom environment on UNITY game engine comprising of various 3D Models Designed in Autodesk 3DS MAX and it consists of a variety of guns with different recoil rates and damage effect. The next thing is a solenoid which is used as a recoil mechanism when solenoid is powered it get repelled by a permanent magnet hence creating a perfect recoil effect . Depending upon turns and voltage applied it can generate different recoil effect. Then a precisely calibrated MPU-6050 is placed to control the gun crosshair the results are really close to real time if used with a right amount of processing power and code. Our vest have been designed with vibration sensors which are triggered if a person is hit in simulation depending upon position being hit. Our walking band also includes a MPU 6065 which again when combined with a precise processing code performs really well. All the data sent by the Sensors are sent
to ARDUINO which in turn are sent to our main PC by serial communication.

Software Used :

1) Maya 3DS
2) Unity 3D
3) Processing
4) Adruino
